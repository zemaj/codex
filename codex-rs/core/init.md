Please analyze this codebase and create a AGENTS.md file containing:
1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.

Usage notes:
- The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 20 lines long.
- If there's already an AGENTS.md, improve it.
- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them.
- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:

# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to OpenAI Codex (openai.com/codex) when working with code in this repository.
