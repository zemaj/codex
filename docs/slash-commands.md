# Slash Commands

Codex CLI supports a set of slash commands you can type at the start of the
composer input. These commands provide quick actions, toggles, or expand into
full prompts. This document lists all built‑in commands and what they do.

Notes

- Commands are shown in the TUI’s slash popup; the order below matches the UI.
- Commands marked “prompt‑expanding” transform your input into a full prompt and
  typically kick off multi‑agent flows.
- Some commands accept arguments; if required, usage is shown in parentheses.

## Navigation & Session

- `/browser`: open internal browser.
- `/chrome`: connect to Chrome.
- `/new`: start a new chat during a conversation.
- `/resume`: resume a past session for this folder.
- `/quit`: exit Codex.
- `/logout`: log out of Codex.
- `/login`: manage Code sign-ins (select, add, or disconnect accounts).

## Workspace & Git

- `/init`: create an `AGENTS.md` file with instructions for Codex.
- `/diff`: show `git diff` (including untracked files).
- `/undo`: open a snapshot picker so you can restore workspace files to a
  previous Code snapshot and optionally rewind the conversation to that point.
- `/branch [task]`: create a worktree branch and switch to it. If a
  task/description is provided, it is used when naming the branch. Must be run
  from the repository root (not inside another branch worktree).
- `/merge`: merge the current worktree branch back into the default branch and
  remove the worktree. Run this from inside the worktree created by `/branch`.
- `/review [focus]`: without arguments, opens a review picker so you can audit
  the workspace, a specific commit, compare against another branch, or enter
  custom instructions. With a focus argument, skips the picker and uses your
  text directly.
- `/cmd <name>`: run a project command defined for the current workspace.

## UX & Display

- `/theme`: switch between color themes.
- `/verbosity (high|medium|low)`: change text verbosity.
- `/model`: choose what model and reasoning effort to use.
- `/reasoning (minimal|low|medium|high)`: change reasoning effort.
- `/prompts`: show example prompts.
- `/status`: show current session configuration and token usage.
- `/limits`: visualize current hourly and weekly rate-limit usage.
- `/update`: check the installed version, detect available upgrades, and run the
  appropriate installer when possible.
- `/mcp`: manage MCP servers (status/on/off/add).
- `/validation [status|on|off|<tool> (on|off)]`: inspect or toggle validation
  harness settings.

## Search & Mentions

- `/mention`: mention a file (opens the file search for quick insertion).

## Performance & Agents

- `/perf (on|off|show|reset)`: performance tracing controls.
- `/agents`: list agents (running and availability).
- `/pro [on|off|toggle|status|auto (on|off|toggle|status)]`: manage Pro mode,
  including autonomous follow-ups and observer status (available in dev,
  dev-fast, and pref builds).

## Prompt‑Expanding (Multi‑Agent)

These commands expand into full prompts (generated by `codex-core`) and
typically start multiple agents. They require a task/problem description.

- `/plan <task>`: create a comprehensive plan (multiple agents). Prompt‑expanding.
- `/solve <problem>`: solve a challenging problem (multiple agents). Prompt‑expanding.
- `/code <task>`: perform a coding task (multiple agents). Prompt‑expanding.

## Development‑Only

- `/demo`: populate the chat history with assorted sample cells (available in
  dev and perf builds for UI testing).
- `/test-approval`: test approval request (available in debug builds only).

Implementation Notes

- The authoritative list of commands is defined in
  `codex-rs/tui/src/slash_command.rs` (the `SlashCommand` enum). When adding a
  new command, please update this document to keep the UI and docs in sync.
- Prompt formatting for `/plan`, `/solve`, and `/code` lives in
  `codex-rs/core/src/slash_commands.rs`.
